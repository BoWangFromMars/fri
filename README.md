# Fast Robot Interface
The Fast Robot Interface library allows for hard real time communication to the KUKA LBR Med, see KUKA's [paper](http://www.best-of-robotics.org/pages/publications/KUKA_FRI_from_WS_Proceedings_ICRA2010.pdf). This folder contains the C++ client side library to setup the UDP connection to the LBR Med.
